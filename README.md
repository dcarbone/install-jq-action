## Action Inputs

#### version
```yaml
  version:
    required: false
    description: "Version of jq to install"
    default: "1.7"
```

This must be a version with a [corresponding release](https://github.com/stedolan/jq/releases).

#### force
```yaml
  force:
    required: false
    description: "If 'true', does not check for existing jq installation before continuing."
    default: 'false'
```

GitHub's own hosted runners come with a version of
[jq pre-installed](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-github-hosted-runners/about-github-hosted-runners#preinstalled-software).

Setting this to `true` will install the version you specify into the tool cache, superseding the preinstalled version.
Setting this to true can also help ensure the same version is used across both self-hosted and remote runners. 

## Action Outputs

#### found
```yaml
  found:
    description: "If 'true', jq was already found on this runner"
```

#### installed
```yaml
  installed:
    description: "If 'true', jq was installed by this action"
```
